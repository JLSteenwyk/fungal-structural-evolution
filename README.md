# Fungal structural evolution

Comparative structural genomics of approximately **500 fungal species plus 25 non-fungal outgroups**. The central question is where structural evolution accelerates or decouples from sequence evolution, and how these changes relate to duplication and ecology.

Status: proteomes acquired for a working set of **501 fungi and 25 genome-backed outgroups (526 taxa)**. A further fungal candidate lacks an available proteome and remains in the candidate manifest with an exclusion record. Full-dataset protein QC and exact-sequence reuse of existing AlphaFold structures are running. Conserved-marker extraction and alignment scripts are implemented; species-tree inference and evolutionary analyses remain pending. Full-scale design; no separate pilot.

## Reproduction
Python 3.10+ standard library suffices for NCBI metadata inventory; openpyxl is used to import published supplementary tables. Run `make inventory` to retrieve public NCBI fungal catalogs, record checksums, and generate candidate tables. These are discovery catalogs, not a final sample. Raw downloads remain in ignored `data/`; versioned metadata records source URLs and hashes.

BUSCO uses the isolated environment specified in `environments/busco.yml`; marker workflows additionally use Biopython and MAFFT. Commands and validation gates are documented in the phylogenetic workflow. Large files must not enter Git history.
